# Predictive-Modelling-for-Rocks-and-Mines-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Model

## Project Overview

The detection of rocks and mines is a critical task in various industries, including mining, construction, and environmental monitoring.
Accurate and timely detection of rocks and mines can prevent accidents, reduces costs, and improve operational efficiency.
In this analysis, I leverage machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that identifies the livelihood of rocks and mines presence in a given area.

## Methodology

1.	Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for analysis.
2.	Feature engineering: Creating new features that capture relevant patterns and relationships in the data
3.	Model selection: Evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms and selecting the most effective one.
4.	Model training: Training the selected model using the preprocessed data.
5.	Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained model using various metrics.

## Results

The analysis demonstrates that machine learning-based predictive model can accurately identify the livelihood of rocks and mines presence in given area.
